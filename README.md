# Elementary Cellular Automata in Java

A little Java program that simulates **elementary cellular automata** for all rules from **0 up to 255**.  

The program is designed to work with configurations using **`.`** (dead cell) and **`x`** (alive cell).  
By default, the first and last cell of each generation must always be a `.` (dot).

## Features
- Supports **all rules (0â€“255)**.  
- You can change the **line length** to control the width of the automaton.  
- You can modify the **initial configuration** (first generation) as you like.  
- Simple console output using only `.` and `x`.
